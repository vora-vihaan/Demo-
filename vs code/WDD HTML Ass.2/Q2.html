        <h1>example of box model</h1>
        <p> The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that dictates how elements are rendered and sized on a webpage.
            It consists of four key components: the content, padding, border, and margin. The content is the actual area where text, images, or other media are displayed. 
            Padding is the space between the content and the elementâ€™s border, providing a cushion around the content. </p>
